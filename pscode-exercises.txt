// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

number A = userInput
number B = userInput

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


numbers = [numA, numB, numC, numD, numE]
x = array size

sum = 0
average = 0
min = numbers[0]
max = numbers[0]



for x in numbers
	
	numbers[x] = userInput
	
	sum = sum + numbers[x]
	
	average = sum/x


		if min > numbers[x]
		
			min = numbers[x]
		
		if max < numbers [x]
			
			max = numbers[x]

print numbers[] "these are the numbers that you entered"

print max "this is the largest of the numbers you entered"

print min "this is the smallest of the numbers you entered"

print average "this is the average of the numbers that you entered"
